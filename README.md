LLMs are improving the capabilities of existing computer vision services at a rapid pace. A great example of this incredible progress can be seen [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-mechanics-blog/how-do-llms-work-with-vision-ai-ocr-image-amp-video-analysis/ba-p/3835661#:~:text=Cognitive%20Service%20for%20Vision%20AI%20combines%20both%20natural,automatic%20image%20classification%2C%20object%20detection%2C%20and%20image%20segmentation).

For this project, we would like to provide an example of implementing these incredibly recent advancements with Edge devices. This will provide a starting point for a wide variety of potential use cases, thereby enabling developers and customers who want to take advantage of this technology at the Edge to achieve more!

Here are some examples of potential use cases for this project (generated with Chat GPT, of course).

Enhanced Image and Video Captioning: Edge devices integrated with LLMs can provide detailed and accurate captions for images and videos, improving accessibility and enabling new applications like automatic video summarization.

Healthcare Diagnostics: Medical devices with AI at the edge can interpret patient data and communicate results using natural language. LLMs can assist doctors by generating detailed reports or explanations of diagnoses and treatment options.

Industrial IoT and Maintenance: In manufacturing settings, LLMs at the edge can analyze sensor data from equipment and machinery, providing real-time insights into maintenance needs, troubleshooting steps, and operational improvements.

Retail and Customer Support: LLM-powered kiosks or apps in retail stores can assist customers with product inquiries, offering detailed explanations, comparisons, and reviews.

Tourism and Navigation: LLM-equipped devices can offer guided tours of historical sites, museums, and cities, providing information and context in natural language as visitors explore.
